- Pierre asks how his 3rd party contrib module database can be made useful
  - we should keep track of which version is currently imported, how out-of-date it is, etc.
  - we want to keep track of maintainers for each module- document procedures for importing new versions (which tests to run etc.) so that maintainership is easier to hand over
  - Warner notes that we don't have a consistent definition of "maintainer".
  - Should we put contrib maintainers in MAINTAINERS?
  - MAINTAINERS is out-of-date and not machine-parseable, but we should probably start by recording ownership there.
- Went through agenda items
  - John and Warner will start discussions on architecture removal for 16.0 (powerpc64 and armv7)
