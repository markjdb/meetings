- John asks for suggestions on devsummit talks
  - scheduler improvements
  - next steps for pkgbase
  - jlduran's nanobsd improvements?
    - Warner will talk to him
  - srcmgr should give a (probably short?) talk, near the beginning of have/need/want
- Gleb wants to formalize stabweeks
  - move scripts out of Gleb's homedir
  - use branches instead of tags
    - tag deletion isn't propagated to clones
    - some sort of rolling schedule to delete stabweek branches
  - build binary snapshots from stabweeks
    - rebuild snapshots if fixes are cherry-picked back to stabweek branches
  - both binary snapshots and branches would provide a good first-pass for bisection of regressions
  - need to know who to hand the current scripts off to? (clusteradm@?)
  - mark suggests srcmgr@ should perhaps own this task, perhaps script can just run on freefall
    - srcmgr@ should be the ones to cherry-pick changes to stabweek branches, following re@'s new model
  - should we mirror stabweek branches to e.g. github?
    - Warner suggests we shouldn't, we should handle them like vendor branches
    - Gleb thinks we should, they're intended to be used by users and contributors, unlike vendor branches which are more developer-centric
    - Deleted stabweek branches won't be pruned in clones automatically
    - Mark notes we are aiming to build binary artifacts (snapshot releases,
      pkg repos) from these branches in which case users will really want to
      use the binary artifacts more than the git branch directly
    - We can always decide to push the branches later if demand warrants it
  - Warner doesn't think we need stabweeks on stable/N branches as our existing snapshots work well enough
  - Warner: Should we eventually ask pkgmgr@ to use stabweeks as their base system images for building ports packages against main?
- Looked at 14.x regressions, list curated by Mark Linimon
