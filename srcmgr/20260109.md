- Warner wishes to discuss an issue related to CAM APIs
  - A kernel function was changed, but it's exposed as an interface in libcam.so
  - The change will be reverted
- Dag-Erling says that a lot of 32-bit compat interfaces are missing
- Also that ports kmod repos are built against stable branches, not the release branch
- We should email bapt@, he is publishing those repos
- John points out there was some ipfw compatibility breakage that made it into 15.0 as well
  - https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=291562
  - We should email ae@ about this (jhb@ will do this)
- upgrading 15.0 uninstalls wifi firmware, as it was moved to ports, so upgrading can leave you without working wifi
  - we need to document a workaround in the release notes
- Commit bit for Seyed Pouria Mousavizadeh Tehrani
- Date for next bug-busting session
  - January 30th?
- Commit bit reaping- not sure about how to handle developers@ access.
- we should ask first and leave them subscribed for a bit if no reply is forthcoming
- Olivier: Please have a look at the updated https://reviews.freebsd.org/D52885 (proposed
  changes to style(9) to encourage code style modifications as part of other
  modifications).
- Spent some time looking for commits to tag in release notes
