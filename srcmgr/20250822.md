# 20250822 srcmgr meeting

Attendees: markj, jfree, imp, des, jhb, kevans

- Warner asks about AI use policy
  - two problems: intellectual property and competency
  - Warner claims that AI tools are past the point where they're copying and pasting code
  - there's nuance around whether we're talking about line completion on steroids, or having LLMs produce large gobs of code
  - we already have to worry about contributors submitting incorrect or copy-pasted code, so the level of skepticism towards external contributors doesn't really change
  - different extremes: auto-completing `SYSCTL_INT(<tab>` vs. "here's a datasheet, write me a driver"
  - want an informal policy: as long as the LLM isn't doing "most" of the work, it's ok
  - you need to understand everything in the submitted patch
  - AI tool use should perhaps be explicitly attributed (e.g. a git trailer)
- Need to schedule a bug-busting session soon
  - Warner wants to do a separate GHPR landing session too
- jhb notes that we have a spare day during eurobsdcon, we should do something with it
- des notes that pkgbase still needs a lot of work
  - it's hard to consistently use pkg for ports vs. base
  - open usability questions
  - installer support is experimental
  - issues with missing directories (e.g., /etc/zfs)
  - do we want a "hidden" per-repo pkg option
- proposal for pkgbase: there are several modes:
  - freebsd-update-managed: pkg only operates on ports packages, use freebsd-update
    - kyle suggests a new "hidden" tag for repos that leaves the repo enabled when explicitly used, but not auto-discovered
    - bsdinstall might "hide" the base repo by default so that freebsd-update works out of the box
    - document how to unhide base for users who want to use pkg directly
    - for now, freebsd-update hides the base repos from the user
  - pkg-managed: you use pkg to manage the base system and ports repos, it's up to you to not blow your foot off
  - src-managed
    - need to bootstrap etcupdate post-install before first upgrade
    - make installworld probably doesn't update pkg metadata (separate make installworld-packages perhaps?)
    - maybe document how to flush base package database entries
    - what to do if ports start depending on base system packages?
