# 20250822 srcmgr meeting

Attendees: markj, jfree, imp, des, jhb, kevans

- Warner asks about AI use policy
  - two problems: intellectual property and competency
  - Warner claims that AI tools are past the point where they're copying and pasting code
  - there's nuance around whether we're talking about line completion on steroids, or having LLMs produce large gobs of code
  - we already have to worry about contributors submitting incorrect or copy-pasted code, so the level of skepticism towards external contributors doesn't really change
  - different extremes: auto-completing `SYSCTL_INT(<tab>` vs. "here's a datasheet, write me a driver"
  - want an informal policy: as long as the LLM isn't doing "most" of the work, it's ok
  - you need to understand everything in the submitted patch
  - AI tool use should perhaps be explicitly attributed (e.g. a git trailer)
  - It was noted other projects are also struggling with standards around this area, and the project should track those efforts so the policy is in line with the rest of the larger open source community
- Need to schedule a bug-busting session soon
  - Warner wants to do a separate GHPR landing session too
- jhb notes that we have a spare day during eurobsdcon, we should do something with it
- des notes that pkgbase still needs a lot of work
  - it's hard to consistently use pkg for ports vs. base
  - open usability questions
  - installer support is experimental
  - issues with missing directories (e.g., /etc/zfs)
  - do we want a "hidden" per-repo pkg option
- proposal for pkgbase: there are several modes:
  - freebsd-update-managed: pkg only operates on ports packages, use freebsd-update
    - kyle suggests a new "hidden" tag for repos that leaves the repo enabled when explicitly used, but not auto-discovered
    - bsdinstall might "hide" the base repo by default so that freebsd-update works out of the box
    - document how to unhide base for users who want to use pkg directly
    - for now, freebsd-update hides the base repos from the user
  - pkg-managed: you use pkg to manage the base system and ports repos, it's up to you to not blow your foot off
  - src-managed
    - need to bootstrap etcupdate post-install before first upgrade
    - make installworld probably doesn't update pkg metadata (separate make installworld-packages perhaps?)
    - maybe document how to flush base package database entries
    - what to do if ports start depending on base system packages?
