- Granted a commit bit to Timothy Pearson for powerpc64 work

- Olivier has been going through the 15.0 release notes
  - Some discrepancies and inconsistencies
    - First lines of paragraph have different styles (telegraphic, directly from commit messages, or rewritten ones; some have the component first before `:`, others do not).
    - The commit messages of the updates to `RELNOTES` have been copied, instead of the actual text that went into `RELNOTES`.
    - Some paragraphs are too developer- or internals-oriented and are unlikely to make sense to the intended audience.
    - Some changes are referenced under "Manual Pages" instead of the proper section.
    - Discrepancy of style for "Sponsored by" notes.
  - Who owns the release notes?
  - In the past, Mike Karels took charge of this, but no one really owns them now, it seems
  - Olivier is working on a patch to clean up some nits
  - Really, srcmgr probably needs to own release notes going forward, or delegate that to others
  - Some existing release note entries don't make sense (e.g., just documenting some change to kernel internals); release notes must be relevant to end-users
  - Dag-Erling provides some suggestions on how to enumerate Relnotes-tagged commits
    - git log --grep '[Rr]elnotes' freebsd/releng/14.0..freebsd/releng/15.0
  - Olivier will do a pass over Relnotes-tagged commits, will report about what was checked.
  - Dag-Erling suggests that we could have a CI job which looks for new release note tags
  - We need to keep release notes up-to-date on an ongoing basis, rather than waiting until just before the release
  - pkgbase isn't documented at all

- Dag-Erling is seeing an issue on main where pkg gets stuck while creating packages
  - pkg seems to be looping in pmap_enter()
  - will retry with INVARIANTS enabled

- Jake is seeing a kqueue panic, will report on bugzilla
  - https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=291269

- Closed https://github.com/freebsd/srcmgr/issues/3
  - Seems to be working now

- Had a bug-busting session on 2025/11/21
  - Attendance was fairly small
  - Spent time on bugs opened on or after Oct. 1
  - Nothing very alarming that should block 15.0

- armv7 and powerpc64 removal proposals generated a lot of discussion
  - it looks like we will keep at least powerpc64le

- phabricator reports are being published in https://people.freebsd.org/~bnovkov/stale_reviews/
  - but srcmgr still not seeing any email
